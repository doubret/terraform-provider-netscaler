# citrix-netscaler-nitro-11-yaml-specs

Yaml specifications of the Citrix Netscaler nitro api version 11.

This project modelizes the Netscaler nitro configuration api using yaml files.

A resource is described through a key that uniquely identifies an instance, a list of fields, eventually a state, and a list of updatable fields.
A binding is described through a source and target resources, plus optional fields that describe the binding.
At the difference of a resource, a binding can not be updated/renamed.

These specs are used to automate the creation of the following projects :
- [Citrix Netscaler NITRO client written in go](https://github.com/doubret/citrix-netscaler-nitro-go-client)
- [Terraform provider plugin for Citrix Netscaler](https://github.com/doubret/terraform-provider-netscaler)

## Documentations
